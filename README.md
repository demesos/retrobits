# RetroBits  
A collection of small C64 games with source code.  

## About  
These are short games I wrote just for fun—sometimes to test ideas or experiment with new techniques.  

## Requirements  
To build the games, ensure the following tools are installed and available in your system's PATH:  
- **[cc65](https://cc65.github.io/)**: A complete cross-development package for 6502-based systems.  
- **[LAMAlib](https://github.com/demesos/LAMAlib)**: A library for handling common tasks in C64 game development.  
- **Python**: Needed for auxiliary scripts like `petscii2x.py`.  
- **Make**: For managing the build process.  

## The Games  

### Moonlander  
My take on the classic moon landing game. Written in Assembler. The objective is simple: land the lunar module ("The Eagle") softly on the designated site. The game is somewhat difficult. Gameplay confined to a single screen. Game was originally created in January 2024 for the *OneHourGameJam #454*.
